# The Garden Plan — loop-enabled M1 execution

Companion to docs/SPEC.md v1.9. This is OPERATIONS, not constitution: it may
change freely; the spec may not. This document is written to be executed by a
relay of agents, generation 0 through n, each arriving with no memory of the
last. Everything an agent needs is in files; nothing lives in anyone's head.

**Workspace layout (created by Agent Zero, P0):**
```
garden/            # ops repo: THIS file (PLAN.md), SPEC.md (the MASTER
                   #   constitution), BOARD.md, FLAGS.md, AMENDMENTS.md,
                   #   reports/          remote: Nate0-1999/garden
spine/             # product repo (SPEC C.1)   remote: Nate0-1999/memory-palace
harness/           # product repo (SPEC C.1)   remote: Nate0-1999/harness
```
All three are sibling git repos in one workspace. Sessions launch at the
workspace root. `garden/SPEC.md` is the constitution's master; each product
repo carries a frozen copy at `docs/SPEC.md`, refreshed only at human gates.
Amending the master is a human act — agents propose via FLAGS, or enact
qualifying COMPLETIONS via AMENDMENTS.md (Section 2), and never edit
SPEC.md themselves.

**Cloud footprint (D1; state as of 2026-07-19):** GCP project
`n8-memory-palace` (us-central1) is LIVE with a $100/month budget alerting
at 50/90/100% (alerts, not a hard stop — an auto-shutoff function is a
possible follow-up). Cloud SQL `n8-memory-palace-db` (Postgres 16,
db-f1-micro) is created; pgvector arrives with migration 0001. Secrets live
ONLY in `harness/.env` (untracked; `.env.example` is the shape): SPINE_TOKEN
(generated), OPENROUTER (verified live, minimax-m3 dev default per C.5),
OPENAI for embeddings (key valid but account quota EXHAUSTED — the human
must add credits before D1's verification step). REMAINING for D1, human
only: create spine db/user; run Alembic through cloud-sql-proxy; deploy
Cloud Run service `n8-memory-palace-spine` from the spine Dockerfile
(migrations never run at container boot); verify /healthz plus a
real-embed create → dedup → prepare → commit round trip; record the URL in
the D1 claim and set DONE. Local `docker compose` remains the C.8
acceptance path; the cloud spine is the always-on heart.

## 0. THE BOOT SEQUENCE — every agent, every session, in this order

You are one runner in a relay. The runners before you left everything you
need in files; the runners after you will have only what you leave in files.

**STEP 1 — Law.** Read `garden/PLAN.md` (this file) top to bottom. Read
`garden/AMENDMENTS.md` — enacted completions there are law, equal to the
spec. Read the `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` ground rules in any repo you will
touch. Do NOT read the whole spec yet — your packet will name its sections.

**STEP 2 — Ground truth.** Read `garden/BOARD.md`. Read the LAST handoff
report in `garden/reports/` (at most the last three — respect your context;
older history is in git if truly needed). Then VERIFY inherited ground: run
the test suites of both product repos. If anything is red, broken, or
contradicts the last report's claims, your role is FIXER (Section 3) — the
board's next packet waits. **Never build on unverified ground.**

**STEP 3 — Dispatch.** Determine your role from the board using Section 3's
rules. The situation assigns your role; the human does not need to.

**STEP 4 — Claim.** Edit BOARD.md: set your packet IN_PROGRESS with a session
tag (tool + date + short id) and commit this claim to `garden` BEFORE any
other work. The claim-commit is your baton pickup.

**STEP 5 — Focused law.** Now read exactly the spec sections your packet
charge names — fully, at full attention, nothing more.

**STEP 6 — Work.** Within CONTRACTS (SPEC 1.4). Journal every non-dictated
decision in the repo's DECISIONS.md citing a Problem Tree node. Defects you
discover: Blight Protocol (SPEC 2.1) — fix at the deepest containing node or
flag. A contract that is silent or self-inconsistent on a detail you need:
COMPLETION — enact it in AMENDMENTS.md and keep moving (Section 2 says what
qualifies). Anything requiring a FORBIDDEN feature or a true contract
change: STOP, write a FLAG (Section 4), set your packet BLOCKED, end your
session.

**STEP 7 — Handoff ritual.** In order: packet exit criteria met → both test
suites green → DECISIONS.md entries committed → handoff report written
(template, Section 4) → BOARD.md updated (DONE, or honestly back to TODO /
BLOCKED with the report explaining why) → all commits pushed with your packet
id in messages. **A clean unfinished handoff beats a dirty finished one** —
returning a half-done packet with an honest report is success, not failure.

**STEP 8 — Stop.** One packet per session. Do not begin the next packet, no
matter how much context or energy remains. Fresh ground needs fresh eyes.

---

## 1. BOARD.md — the state ledger

Agent Zero instantiates it from Section 5's packet list. One row per packet:

```
| id | packet             | deps      | status       | claim              | verdict |
|----|--------------------|-----------|--------------|--------------------|---------|
| P0 | Agent Zero         | —         | TODO         |                    |         |
| S1 | DB layer & CAS     | P0        | TODO         |                    |         |
...
```

**Statuses:** TODO · IN_PROGRESS · DONE · BLOCKED (see FLAGS.md) ·
FAILED_JUDGMENT (see verdict path).

**Rules:**
- Claim only a TODO packet whose deps are all DONE. If several qualify,
  take the lowest id (determinism beats optimization).
- HUMAN packets (marked in Section 5; currently D1) are never claimed by an
  agent. If every dependency-ready packet is HUMAN, write no code: end the
  session directing the human to the gate.
- **Stale claim recovery:** an IN_PROGRESS claim from a session that left no
  handoff report is stale after inspection confirms the session is dead.
  Inspect its branch: salvage what passes tests into your work if trivial,
  otherwise reset the packet to TODO, journal what you found, and note it in
  your report. Never silently adopt unverified work.
- Only the claiming session edits its row (plus the human, who may edit
  anything).

## 2. AMENDMENTS.md & FLAGS.md — solve it yourself, or stop the line

Contract trouble has two exits. Take the first whenever it qualifies; the
second is for what the first cannot carry.

**AMENDMENTS.md — decide-and-declare (the default).** Where law is SILENT or
SELF-INCONSISTENT on a detail your packet needs — a missing field, an
undefined response shape, a promise the DDL forgot — do not halt: choose the
minimal completion that honors the spec's stated intent, append it to
`garden/AMENDMENTS.md` as an EXACT spec diff (template, Section 4), cite the
amendment id in DECISIONS.md, and build against it. Enacted amendments are
law for every later agent and the judge. The human audits them at the normal
between-session review and may veto; a veto becomes a FIXER charge.
A completion QUALIFIES only if it (a) touches no Invariant (SPEC 1.3), no
FORBIDDEN row (B.4), no auth or data-loss semantics; (b) reverses no ADR;
(c) changes nothing an already-DONE packet built; (d) contradicts no
explicit spec sentence — it fills silence or repairs an internal
contradiction in the direction the spec itself points. Rule of thumb: if a
wrong guess would rework committed work or violate standing law, FLAG; if it
can be completed compatibly and declared where every future agent will read
it, complete it and move on.

**FLAGS.md — stop-the-line.** Append-only. A FLAG is how an agent halts
safely when completion does not qualify: FORBIDDEN-feature need, Invariant
conflict, ADR reversal, a Blight-Protocol escalation (fix would disturb an
ancestor node), or a genuine design fork (two readings, materially different
products). Format:
`[flag-id] [packet] [tree node] — what was found, why COMPLETION does not
qualify, the minimal proposed change, what it disturbs.`
A BLOCKED packet stays blocked until the human resolves the flag (usually by
amending the spec) and resets the row to TODO.

## 3. Role dispatch (derived from the board, in priority order)

1. **FIXER** — Step 2 found broken ground, a packet row says
   FAILED_JUDGMENT, or the human vetoed an amendment (the veto note in
   AMENDMENTS.md is your charge). Claim that repair: your charge is the last
   report, the verdict file, or the veto; fix per the Blight Protocol; do
   not add features.
2. **JUDGE** — all build packets (S*, H*, I1) are DONE and J is TODO.
   **Independence check: if your context contains ANY build work from this
   milestone, REFUSE the role** — end the session instructing the human to
   launch a fresh one (different model preferred). A judge with build
   context is a rubber stamp.
3. **BUILDER** — otherwise: claim the next eligible packet (Section 1 rules)
   and follow its charge (Section 5).
4. **NOBODY** — board shows all DONE and J passed: M1 is complete. Write a
   closing report; instruct the human that M2 planning opens (SPEC B.1:
   M3 re-plans then too). Build nothing.

## 4. Templates

**Handoff report** (`garden/reports/NNN-<packet>.md`):
```
packet:            S3 — Scorer v0 + inject/prepare
session:           claude-code / 2026-07-.. / a1b2
status:            DONE | RETURNED_TODO | BLOCKED
what exists now:   (2-6 lines, concrete: files, endpoints, behaviors)
deviations:        (DECISIONS.md entry ids + tree nodes, or "none")
evidence:          (test names, verification/ paths)
notes to the next agent:  <- the generational memory; write what you wish
                   you had been told: surprises, fragile spots, half-truths
                   in your own work, the fastest path into the code.
```

**FLAG:** see Section 2 format.

**Amendment** (`garden/AMENDMENTS.md`, append-only):
```
[A-NNN] [packet] [spec section] [tree node]
gap: what the spec fails to say, or says twice differently (one sentence)
law: the exact contract text as it now stands — a precise diff or the full
     amended body/DDL/shape, complete enough that both repos and the judge
     implement identically from this entry alone
why: how this is the spec's own intent completed, not new design (one line)
```

## 5. Packet charges

Every charge implicitly begins with the Boot Sequence. "Sections" = the only
spec reading required.

**P0 — Agent Zero (groundskeeper).** Charge: SPEC C.10 verbatim, PLUS:
create the `garden` repo with PLAN.md (this file), BOARD.md instantiated
from this section, empty FLAGS.md, reports/ with your own report as 000;
create CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md in both product repos from the template in
Section 6. Human reviews your journal entries and report for cultural fit
before the relay continues.

**Spine track**
- **S1 — DB layer & CAS rules.** Sections: C.2, ADR-004. Deliver: models
  matching the DDL exactly; transactional CAS-update + revision-write
  helper; tombstone helper; tests incl. forced 409 and parent_uid lineage.
  Nodes: P1.3.
- **S2 — Memory CRUD + dedup bands.** Sections: C.4 (/v1/memories, PATCH,
  GET), C.5. Deliver: create with 0.92/0.80 bands (409 duplicate /
  similar[] / insert + force), PATCH with CAS, paged list; embedding
  provider behind the C.1 interface with a deterministic fake for tests.
  Nodes: P1.4, P1.1.
- **S3 — Scorer v0 + inject/prepare.** Sections: C.3, C.4 (prepare),
  ADR-005. Deliver: six features exactly per formulas; pgvector candidate
  pool; budget-greedy selection; near-misses; pinned bypass; snapshot_ts
  semantics; injection_event writes with full features. Golden tests:
  hand-computed scores on fixed fixtures — computed from the SPEC, not from
  the code. Nodes: P1.2.
- **S4 — Commit, feedback, quarantine.** Sections: C.4 (commit, feedback),
  C.3 (never rule), C.6 (final_block format). Deliver: outcome writes;
  never → bias → quarantine at 3; "wrong" returns unit; exact final_block
  renderer; stats updates. Nodes: P1.2.1a–d. (Deps: S3, S5 — S5 first:
  S4's wrong_removed serializes MemoryUnit, which now carries origin_path.)
- **S5 — origin_path metadata.** Sections: C.2, C.4 (v1.6 surfaces),
  ADR-005 location-relevance note. Deliver: migration 0002 adding
  origin_path; create/PATCH/MemoryUnit surfaces carrying it; scoring
  UNTOUCHED (inert metadata — scorer v0 neither reads it nor may any later
  scorer penalize its absence, per the null rule); tests. Nodes: P1.3.
  (Deps: S3.)
- **S6 — /v1/search.** Sections: C.4 (search, shared shapes), C.3
  (candidate rule). Deliver: POST /v1/search per the exact body — embed
  query; top-k by cosine over ACTIVE units of the principal, applying the
  C.3 project filter when project_key is supplied; results as MemoryCards
  with score = cosine similarity, features/rank null; tests on
  deterministic embeddings. The last 501 dies here. Nodes: P1.1.
  (Deps: S2.)

**Cloud gate**
- **D1 — GCP deploy & remote verification (HUMAN — agents never claim).**
  Sections: ADR-003, C.8. The human, assisted outside the relay, deploys
  spine to Cloud Run with Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL + pgvector per ADR-003,
  runs Alembic there, and re-verifies the S1–S4 surface against the cloud
  URL with real embeddings: /healthz, then a create → dedup → prepare →
  commit round trip. Exit: BOARD row DONE with the cloud URL noted in the
  claim; H5 and later harness work exercise the deployed spine (contract
  tests may still use a local container; C.8 criterion 1 still runs on
  local compose). (Deps: S4.) Rationale: B.3 commits M1 to "spine on Cloud
  Run" — the gate exists so the relay cannot finish M1 having only ever
  talked to localhost.
- **D2 — Billing circuit breaker (build: agent; deploy: HUMAN).** Sections:
  none (pure infra; pattern: Google's documented "disable billing with
  notifications"). Deliver in spine `infra/billing-breaker/`: a Cloud Run
  function (Python 3.12) subscribed to a `billing-breaker` Pub/Sub topic
  that parses budget notifications and, when costAmount >= budgetAmount,
  DETACHES billing from project `n8-memory-palace` via the Cloud Billing
  API (updateBillingInfo, empty billingAccountName) — deliberately
  terminating all project services; idempotent and decision-logged; unit
  tests on fixture notifications with NO live cloud calls; a deploy script
  that creates the topic, points the existing $100 budget at it, and
  deploys the function under a dedicated service account holding Project
  Billing Manager on this project ONLY; a README runbook with a
  synthetic-message drill and billing re-attach steps. Agents build and
  test but NEVER execute the deploy script or any gcloud mutation — the
  human runs the runbook at a gate. Revisit when Google's Spend Caps
  (private preview 2026; covers Cloud Run but NOT Cloud SQL) reaches GA.
  Nodes: P4. (Deps: P0.)

**Harness track**
- **H1 — Envelope + daemon WS.** Sections: C.7, C.1. Deliver: envelope
  models, WS server, type routing, malformed-envelope rejection tests.
  Nodes: P3. (Eligible after P0.)
- **H2 — spine_client + contract tests.** Sections: C.4. Deliver: typed
  client mirroring every body; contract-test job against a live spine
  container covering S1–S2. Nodes: P1.1. (Deps: S2.)
- **H3 — Agent + memory tools.** Sections: C.6 (tools, instructions,
  /remember), C.5, ADR-013. Deliver: pydantic-ai agent — chat + memory
  tools ONLY; docstrings per spec; similar/409 surfaced to the model;
  /remember with generated label. MemoryCapability is the ADR-013 seam's
  FIRST feature: define the minimal internal capability protocol and the
  single adapter module; ship it as a pydantic-ai v2 Capability subclass;
  nothing outside the adapter imports pydantic-ai capability machinery.
  Nodes: P1.2, P1.4. (Deps: H2.)
- **H4 — Web shell + chat.** Sections: C.1 web/, C.7, ADR-009 mobile law.
  Deliver: responsive SPA — thread list, chat pane, run.delta streaming;
  sane at 390px. Nodes: P2, P3. (Deps: H1.)
- **H5 — The gate.** Sections: C.6 steps 1–4, ADR-005 gate UX. Deliver:
  prepare-on-send; modal with full bodies + per-feature scores; one-tap ✕,
  modifier reasons, near-miss add-back; hard pause; commit → run. Nodes:
  P1.2.1a–c. (Deps: S4, H4.) The human personally uses the result before
  the relay continues (Section 7).
- **H6 — Memory panel.** Sections: C.6 (live panel), C.4 (feedback, PATCH).
  Deliver: live list; ad-hoc remove → mid_thread_removed → re-render next
  call; edit flow with CAS conflict surfacing; manual pin toggle. Nodes:
  P1.2.1d, P1.3. (Deps: H5.)

**Closing**
- **I1 — Integration & AC dry run.** Sections: C.8. Deliver: compose
  end-to-end; walk all seven criteria as a BUILDER (not judge); fix gaps;
  seed demo memories; verification/README pointing a judge at everything.
  (Deps: all S*, H*.)
- **J — Judge.** Sections: B.6, C.8, C.9, plus garden/AMENDMENTS.md
  (enacted amendments are law) — nothing else. Fresh session, different
  model than the builders (Codex if built by Claude Code). Execute J0–J8
  with browser automation for screenshots; produce
  `verification/m1/VERDICT.md`. Any FAIL → set FAILED_JUDGMENT on the
  packets the verdict implicates (or I1 if diffuse); a FIXER inherits the
  verdict.

## 6. CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md template (both product repos)

```
# Ground rules (read every session)
1. You are one runner in a relay governed by ../garden/PLAN.md — run its
   Boot Sequence before anything else.
2. The constitution is docs/SPEC.md (v1.9): sections 1 -> 2 -> B -> C; read
   fully the sections your packet names.
3. You are in Milestone M1 unless your charge says otherwise. Feature
   ledger (SPEC B.4) applies: FORBIDDEN means do not build, stub, or
   "prepare for" — flag instead (garden/FLAGS.md).
4. Every non-dictated decision -> DECISIONS.md, citing a Problem Tree node
   (SPEC §2). Features that cannot name their problem do not get built.
5. Defects -> Blight Protocol (SPEC 2.1): deepest containing node;
   escalate ancestors/contracts via FLAG.
6. Contracts are literal: DDL C.2, API C.4, envelope C.7, invariants 1.3.
   A contract gap or self-contradiction is a COMPLETION (PLAN §2): enact
   it in garden/AMENDMENTS.md and proceed — never guess silently, never
   stall on what qualifies.
7. Done means judged (SPEC B.6): leave experiential + traced evidence.
8. One packet per session. Handoff ritual, then stop.
```

## 7. Tool roles & human calibration gates

- **Claude Code:** primary builder; pre-commit hook greps FORBIDDEN
  patterns (weight updates, extraction, relay client, maintenance jobs,
  auth beyond bearer) and blocks with a pointer to SPEC B.4.
- **Codex:** the judge (fresh sessions, Playwright), and occasional
  second-opinion reviewer of PRs.
- **Code Puppy:** daily driver; after S4, pointing a Code Puppy experiment
  at the spine API is the first live test of ADR-002's bidirectional
  coupling.
- **Human gates (you, between sessions):**
  - after P0 — journal/report culture check; redo P0 if it reads like a
    contractor wrote it (cheapest possible recalibration).
  - after S3 — hand-verify one injection's scores against C.3 by
    calculator (catches golden tests written from code instead of spec).
  - after S4 — execute D1 yourself: spine onto Cloud Run + Cloud SQL,
    verified remotely with real embeddings, before any gate work begins.
  - after H5 — use the gate yourself for a day of real prompts; the gate
    is the product's soul and no judge substitutes for your hands.
  - after J — read VERDICT.md beside its screenshots; only then is M1
    done, and M2 planning opens (SPEC B.1; M3 re-plans too).
- Otherwise your between-session review is: the diff, the DECISIONS.md
  entries, the handoff report, and any new AMENDMENTS.md entries — an
  amendment stands unless you veto it there (append the veto; a FIXER
  inherits it). Supervise the relay closely through S2; loosen as the
  reports earn it.
