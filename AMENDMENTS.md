# AMENDMENTS.md — enacted contract completions (append-only)

Decide-and-declare log per PLAN.md §2 and SPEC 1.4 (COMPLETION class).
Entries here are LAW, equal to docs/SPEC.md, binding on every later agent
and the judge. The human audits new entries at the between-session review;
an amendment stands unless a veto is appended beneath it (a FIXER packet
then reverts it). Only qualifying completions belong here — PLAN §2 defines
the fence; everything past it is a FLAG. Entry format: PLAN §4 template.

Historical note: F001–F005 predate this mechanism and were resolved by the
human directly in SPEC v1.5 (FLAGS.md resolution, 2026-07-17). Numbering
starts at A-001.

[A-001] [S1] [SPEC C.2] [P1.3]
gap: C.2 requires every successful CAS update to write `memory_revision`, but
     does not identify which state that row records or how `updated_at` moves.
law: In C.2's final Rules paragraph, after "all in one transaction", add:
     "A successful cloud-head CAS from revision n to n+1 sets
     `memory_unit.updated_at = now()` and appends exactly one
     `memory_revision` with `revision = n+1`, `parent_uid` equal to the prior
     cloud-head revision's `rev_uid`, and `body` / `label` equal to the
     resulting `memory_unit` values. A failed CAS changes neither table."
why: This makes C.2's stated append-only history and atomic CAS rule executable
     without adding a new field, behavior family, or persistence constraint.

[A-002] [S2] [SPEC C.4] [P1.4]
gap: C.4 requires RFC7807 for errors while also prescribing incompatible exact
     JSON bodies for the memory endpoints' domain-specific 409 responses.
law: Replace C.4's opening error sentence with: "Unless a route specifies an
     exact error body below, errors use RFC7807 JSON. The `label_conflict`,
     `duplicate_of`, and `conflict` 409 bodies specified by POST/PATCH
     `/v1/memories` are exact `application/json` responses and are the only
     C.4 exceptions."
why: This preserves both explicit requirements, including the exact 409 schemas
     already frozen by P0, by narrowing the blanket rule only where it conflicts.

[A-003] [S2] [SPEC C.4 POST /v1/memories] [P1.4]
gap: C.4 defines dedup bands but not deterministic selection, similar-list
     membership, ordering, or the exact threshold boundaries.
law: After POST `/v1/memories`' dedup behavior, add: "Dedup comparisons include
     only ACTIVE units with the same principal. `duplicate_of` is the unit with
     greatest cosine similarity, breaking equal-score ties by `memory_id` ASC.
     `similar` contains every such unit whose score satisfies
     `dedup_sim <= score < dedup_dup`, ordered by score DESC then `memory_id`
     ASC; M1 applies no additional result cap. The configured thresholds are
     inclusive at `dedup_sim` and `dedup_dup` as those inequalities state."
why: This completes the existing two-band behavior with stable, testable output
     and introduces no new filter, score, or caller option.

[A-004] [S2] [SPEC C.4 PATCH /v1/memories/{id}] [P1.1]
gap: C.4 does not say how PATCH maintains the stored embedding or handles null,
     no-op, missing-ID, stale-versus-label, and reactivation cases.
law: After PATCH `/v1/memories/{id}`' behavior, add: "A mutable property whose
     JSON value is null is treated as omitted. With zero remaining mutable
     properties, return RFC7807 422; for an absent memory ID, return RFC7807
     404. A supplied non-null `body` is embedded before the CAS, and a successful
     CAS writes its `body`, `embedding`, and `embedding_model` atomically. The CAS
     condition is evaluated before active-label uniqueness: a stale revision
     returns `{conflict: MemoryUnit}`. Any successful-revision write whose
     resulting status and label would collide with another ACTIVE unit of that
     principal returns `{label_conflict}`, including reactivation without a
     label change."
why: These rules carry C.2's atomic head/embedding and active-label invariants
     through the already-promised PATCH surface without adding mutation fields.

[A-005] [S2] [SPEC C.4 GET /v1/memories] [P1.1]
gap: C.4 names list filters and paging fields but does not define their matching,
     composition, count boundary, or lower bounds.
law: After GET `/v1/memories`' behavior, add: "Supplied filters are ANDed;
     omitted `project_key` and `status` apply no filter. Trim `q`; blank applies
     no filter, otherwise it is a case-insensitive literal substring match over
     `label` or `body`. `total` is the filtered count before paging. Require
     `1 <= limit <= 200` and `offset >= 0`."
why: This gives the existing panel-list parameters their minimal conventional
     meaning while preserving its stated stable order and response shape.

[A-006] [S2] [SPEC C.2, C.4, C.5] [P1.4]
gap: C.2 and C.5 cap labels by characters and bodies by tokens but do not define
     the M1 tokenizer or the API behavior when either limit is exceeded.
law: After POST/PATCH `/v1/memories`' behavior, add: "For M1, label length is
     measured in Unicode code points and body length is measured with the
     `cl100k_base` tokenizer. On create, and for each non-null replacement value
     supplied to PATCH, require `len(label) <= cfg.label_max` and
     `tokens(body) <= cfg.memory_max_tokens`; a violation returns RFC7807 422
     before embedding or any database write."
why: This makes the existing 64-character/128-token atomic-memory limits
     deterministic across providers without changing either configured bound.

[A-007] [S3] [SPEC C.3] [P1.2]
gap: C.3 leaves the keyword tokenizer, decay clock, budget units and rounding,
     tie breaks, pin ordering, rank meaning, and budget-skipped near misses
     undefined even though they change the exact prepare result.
law: After C.3's scorer rules, add: "For scorer v0, `tokens` are maximal runs
     of Unicode alphanumeric characters after lowercase conversion. `kw`
     removes the exact stopword set `{a, an, and, are, as, at, be, by, for,
     from, has, he, in, is, it, its, of, on, that, the, to, was, were, will,
     with}`; each stored keyword is tokenized by the same rule before union.
     Time and human-edit ages are measured from `thread.snapshot_ts`, in
     elapsed seconds divided by 86400, with negative ages clamped to zero; a
     human edit is a `memory_revision` whose editor is exactly `user`. Semantic
     cosine is clamped to `[0,1]`. A project match requires a non-null thread
     project equal to the memory project; a null memory project scores 0.5.
     Eligible `pin=true` units are fetched outside the non-pinned vector pool
     and top-k limit, scored only to populate the explainability fields, ordered
     by `memory_id` ASC, and injected first regardless of threshold or budget.
     Their `cl100k_base` body-token costs reduce the regular budget to no less
     than zero; pins alone may exceed it. The regular budget is
     `min(budget_tokens, floor(budget_pct * model_context_tokens))`, and each
     regular card costs its body's `cl100k_base` tokens. The non-pinned vector
     pool orders cosine DESC then `memory_id` ASC; scored regular candidates
     order score DESC then `memory_id` ASC. Greedy selection scans that order,
     accepts at most `top_k`, and after an over-budget card continues to the
     next. Near misses are the first `near_miss_k` unselected regular candidates
     in score order, including candidates excluded by threshold, budget, or the
     top-k cap. Rank is one-based in the combined complete order: pins first,
     then all regular candidates in score order; returned lists retain those
     ranks even when intervening candidates are not returned. `kind='pinned'`
     without `pin=true` does not bypass scoring."
why: These are deterministic mechanics for the scorer C.3 already specifies;
     they add no feature, signal, or learning behavior.

[A-008] [S3] [SPEC C.4 POST /v1/inject/prepare] [P1.2]
gap: C.4 promises a frozen revision-backed read although C.2 cannot reconstruct
     historical scoring state, while M1 permits only one prepare per thread;
     it also leaves event membership and injection-counter membership unstated.
law: After POST `/v1/inject/prepare`'s behavior, add: "M1 accepts exactly one
     successful prepare per thread, as required by C.6's one-injection flow. A
     thread row with non-null `snapshot_ts` returns RFC7807 409 on another
     prepare. An existing unstamped row may be stamped only when its principal,
     agent, machine, and project fields exactly match the request; mismatch
     returns RFC7807 409. Prompt embedding completes before the atomic database
     phase. That phase uses one repeatable-read transaction, stamps
     `snapshot_ts` from the database clock, reads and scores the heads visible
     at that boundary, writes events, and updates statistics; a conflict rolls
     back the entire phase. Each returned card writes exactly one
     `injection_event`: injected `pin=true` cards use `shown_as='pinned'`, other
     injected cards use `shown_as='injected'`, and near misses use
     `shown_as='near_miss'`; stored score, six features, and rank equal the
     response and outcome is null. To preserve the frozen card for replay and
     commit without changing C.2's DDL, the event's features JSON additionally
     contains `_memory: {label, body, pin, updated_at}` from the scored
     snapshot; the wire `features` object remains the exact six-field C.4
     shape. `stats.injections` increments once and `stats.last_injected_at` is
     set to `snapshot_ts` for each card in `injected`, including pins, and never
     for a near miss. Those server writes use C.2 CAS, append revisions with
     editor `system:inject`, origin machine from the request, and reason
     `inject/prepare`."
why: The one-shot transaction is the smallest implementation of M1's explicit
     one-injection-per-thread law; event snapshots keep the log replayable, and
     the counter rule follows rather than weakens the standing CAS invariant.

[A-009] [S4] [SPEC C.4 POST /v1/inject/commit] [P1.2.1a–c]
gap: The commit body does not define batch membership, invalid choices, outcome
     transitions and retries, add-back statistics, eventless prepares, or the
     transaction and attribution boundary needed to apply its behavior.
law: After POST `/v1/inject/commit`'s behavior, add: "The event batch is every
     `injection_event` row with the requested `injection_id`. Each `removed`
     memory ID must be distinct and name a batch row whose `shown_as` is
     `injected` or `pinned`; each `added_back` ID must be distinct and name a
     `near_miss` row; the lists must be disjoint. Duplicate, foreign, or
     wrong-class choices return RFC7807 422 with no write. No batch rows plus
     nonempty choices returns RFC7807 404. No batch rows plus both lists empty
     succeeds with the canonical zero-member C.6 block and `wrong_removed=[]`;
     because A-008 persists no batch row for a zero-card prepare, this also
     accepts any unknown injection UUID with empty choices in M1.

     The desired commit outcome is `removed:<reason>` for each removed row,
     `kept` for every untouched injected or pinned row, and `added_back` for
     each selected near miss; an unselected near miss remains NULL. Outcomes
     transition from NULL exactly once. Repeating the same desired outcome is
     idempotent. For retry comparison, `cited` or `mid_thread_removed` is a
     descendant of `kept` when `shown_as` is injected/pinned and of
     `added_back` when `shown_as` is near_miss. Any different non-NULL outcome
     returns RFC7807 409 with no write. An all-near-miss commit with no add-back
     is necessarily a durable no-op under the frozen C.2 schema.

     Only a new NULL-to-outcome transition changes head statistics. Each newly
     removed row increments `stats.removals` once. A new `removed:never` also
     increments `stats.never_kills`, adds that event's scorer-version
     `never_bias_step` to `bias`, and changes an ACTIVE head to quarantined when
     the resulting kill count is at least that version's `quarantine_kills`;
     an already quarantined or tombstoned status is preserved. Each newly
     `added_back` row increments `stats.injections` once and sets
     `stats.last_injected_at` to the commit transaction's database clock. Load
     the two never parameters from the event's `scorer_version` row. Apply all
     new event outcomes, head changes, and revisions atomically; update each
     affected head once through C.2 CAS in memory-ID order with editor
     `system:inject`, the event's `machine_id`, and reason
     `inject/commit:<outcome>`. `wrong_removed` contains the post-stat CURRENT
     MemoryUnit for every requested `removed:wrong`, ordered by event rank.

     Final members are rows whose outcome is `kept`, `added_back`, or `cited`,
     ordered by rank ASC then memory_id ASC. Render them only from the frozen
     event `_memory` payload and `memory_kind`, never from a current head."
why: This completes the promised gate decision on A-008's existing rows, keeps
     retries and counters exactly-once without a forbidden schema rewrite, and
     makes the unavoidable zero-card ambiguity harmless and explicit.

[A-010] [S4] [SPEC C.4 POST /v1/feedback] [P1.2.1d]
gap: The feedback endpoint names two signals but does not define membership,
     legal outcome transitions, retries, or their M1 statistic effects.
law: After POST `/v1/feedback`'s response, add: "Feedback targets the single
     `injection_event` matching both IDs; no match returns RFC7807 404. A new
     signal may transition only `kept` or `added_back` to the signal's literal
     outcome. Repeating that same signal is idempotent `{ok:true}` with no new
     write. Outcome NULL, any `removed:*` outcome, or the other feedback signal
     returns RFC7807 409. `mid_thread_removed` also increments the current
     head's `stats.removals` exactly once through C.2 CAS; its event transition,
     head update, and revision are one transaction using editor
     `system:feedback`, the event's `machine_id`, and reason
     `feedback/mid_thread_removed`. It changes no bias, status, citation, or
     other statistic. In M1, `cited` is event-log-only: it writes the outcome
     but does not change `stats.citations`, write a memory revision, or affect
     scorer v0, whose citation feature remains inert."
why: The existing outcome vocabulary can log both signals exactly once while
     preserving C.3's explicit M1 citation inertness and C.2's CAS invariant.

[A-011] [S4] [SPEC C.6 final_block] [P1.2.1c]
gap: The exact block template does not define member ordering, escaping,
     structural newlines, or the zero-member serialization.
law: After C.6's rendered block template, add: "Join structural lines with LF,
     with no blank separator lines and no terminal LF. Emit attributes in
     `label`, `kind`, `updated` order. In attributes escape `&`, `<`, `>`, and
     `"` as `&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, and `&quot;`, and encode tab, LF, and CR as
     `&#9;`, `&#10;`, and `&#13;`. In body text escape only `&`, `<`, and `>`;
     preserve every other character and existing newline. Use frozen event
     values verbatim apart from that escaping. With zero members, return these
     four lines exactly: `<memory_system>`, the two literal preamble lines from
     the template, and `</memory_system>`."
why: Deterministic safe serialization completes the already-fixed XML-shaped
     wire block without adding a field, renderer option, or new behavior family.

[A-012] [S6] [SPEC C.4 POST /v1/search] [P1.1]
gap: C.4 supplies `k=10` and optional `project_key`, while the S6 charge promises
     top-k cosine search, but neither bounds k nor defines omitted-versus-null
     project behavior or the equal-cosine cutoff order.
law: After POST `/v1/search`, add: "Require `1 <= k <= 50`; a violation returns
     RFC7807 422 before embedding. An omitted or JSON-null `project_key` applies
     no project filter. A non-null `project_key` admits only ACTIVE units whose
     `project_key` is NULL or exactly equal to the request value. Results are the
     first k ordered by raw cosine similarity DESC then `memory_id` ASC. Search
     applies no scorer threshold, weights, bias, pin priority, or candidate
     re-ranking; `score` is that raw cosine and `features` / `rank` are null."
why: This completes the existing field, filter, and result contract using C.3's
     M1 pool bound and the established cosine/UUID tie convention, without
     adding a search signal or scorer behavior.

[A-013] [H1] [SPEC C.7] [P3]
gap: C.7 defines the WebSocket envelope but not its frame encoding or the
     deterministic malformed-message rejection that H1 is charged to test.
law: After C.7's M1 type list, add: "Each browser-to-daemon message occupies
     exactly one JSON text frame whose top-level value validates as the C.7
     envelope. A binary frame, invalid JSON, non-object JSON value, or object
     that fails envelope validation is malformed. On the first malformed
     message, the daemon invokes no type handler, closes that `/ws` connection
     with WebSocket code 1008 and reason `invalid C.7 envelope`, and performs no
     further processing on that connection."
why: This makes H1's existing rejection requirement observable and closes the
     binary-frame crash without defining any per-type payload or business flow.

[A-014] [H2] [SPEC C.4 POST /v1/inject/prepare] [P1.1]
gap: C.4 names `model_context_tokens` but does not define its valid domain even
     though the implemented prepare budget requires it to be positive.
law: After POST `/v1/inject/prepare`'s request body, add: "Require
     `model_context_tokens > 0`; a violation returns RFC7807 422 before
     embedding or any database write."
why: This makes the existing implemented/OpenAPI boundary explicit without
     changing prepare behavior, its budget formula, or any completed packet.

[A-015] [H3] [SPEC C.6 save_memory] [P1.4]
gap: C.6 tells the model to call save_memory again with force=true after a
     similar response, but the exact tool signature exposes no force input.
law: Replace `save_memory(label, body, kind, keywords?, project_scoped: bool)`
     with `save_memory(label, body, kind, keywords?, project_scoped: bool,
     force: bool = false)`. Forward force unchanged to C.4 POST /v1/memories.
     The tool never enables or retries force automatically. `true` skips only
     the near-similar band and does not override label or hard-duplicate 409s.
why: This makes C.6's already-required retry executable using C.4's enacted
     force field without adding another behavior family.

[A-016] [H7] [SPEC C.7 v1.12] [P3]
gap: C.7 names the loop messages but does not define their executable payloads,
     acknowledgement/cancellation correlation, queue and snapshot ordering, or
     how an M1 connection identifies the active thread; it also calls
     thread.snapshot D→C while requiring a client request.
law: Complete C.7 v1.12 with the following rules. `run_id` is a
     daemon-generated ULID allocated once when prompt.submit is accepted,
     including when it is queued; `prompt_id` is that inbound envelope's `id`.
     prompt.submit has a non-blank string `prompt` and requires outer
     `thread_id`. These payload members are required: run.started
     `{run_id,prompt_id}`; prompt.queued `{run_id,prompt_id}`; run.cancel
     `{run_id}`; run.delta text/thinking
     `{run_id,kind:"text"|"thinking",text:string}` or event
     `{run_id,kind:"event",event:object}`; run.usage
     `{run_id,requests,input_tokens,output_tokens}`; run.done
     `{run_id,stop_reason,partial}`; gate.open
     `{run_id,kind:"memory_gate",...}`; gate.commit `{run_id,...}`; and
     gate.dismiss `{run_id,...}`. Usage fields are non-negative integer
     cumulative totals for that run and never decrease; C.7's "incremental"
     means that updated cumulative snapshots may be emitted while the run
     advances. `stop_reason` is
     `end_turn|cancelled|error|budget_exceeded`; `partial` is false exactly for
     end_turn and true otherwise. These are minimum object members: additional
     JSON members are allowed and preserved so later gate and event contracts
     can extend them.

     thread.snapshot is bidirectional. A C→D request requires outer
     `thread_id` and payload `{request:true}`. Its D→C response carries
     `{messages,open_gate,active_run}`: `messages` is the daemon's ordered array
     of JSON message objects, including queued prompts and already-produced
     partial work; `open_gate` is null or the current gate.open payload; and
     `active_run` is null or `{run_id,prompt_id,state,usage,queued}`, with state
     `running|waiting_gate|cancelling`, usage in the run.usage shape without a
     second run_id, and queued an ordered array of
     `{run_id,prompt_id,prompt}`. Additional members are allowed and preserved.
     For M1 the daemon keeps one process-local active thread, selected by the
     latest valid thread.snapshot request or prompt.submit. On every WS connect
     it sends exactly one snapshot before live events when that thread exists;
     when none exists it sends none until a request or prompt selects one.
     Requesting an unknown thread returns the empty snapshot. Thread/run state
     survives a socket disconnect for the daemon process lifetime; reconnect
     sends the snapshot only and never replays old deltas or other prior
     events. This local selection is not a session or authorization boundary.

     A prompt received while its thread has a live run is appended once to a
     process-local FIFO and immediately acknowledged by prompt.queued. After
     every terminal run.done, the oldest queued prompt starts once: the prior
     run.done is emitted before its run.started, and the reserved run_id is
     reused. Cancellation applies only to the matching active run. The daemon
     first requests cancellation, awaits model/tool-batch termination and
     records terminal cancelled tool results, preserves all prior
     messages/output, emits gate.dismiss before run.done when a gate was open,
     and emits exactly one run.done(cancelled); no run.delta or run.usage for
     that run follows it. A duplicate cancellation while cancellation is
     pending shares that one confirmation. A stale, unknown, or already-
     terminal run_id produces error `{code:"run_not_active",run_id}` and
     cancels nothing. Queued prompts survive every terminal reason.

     Every daemon-created envelope has a fresh outer ULID `id` and timestamp;
     prompt_id supplies acknowledgement correlation. `type` accepts any
     non-blank string. The required payload validation above applies to known
     M1 behavior types. Reserved names and all other unknown types retain
     arbitrary JSON payloads and pass outer-envelope validation; an endpoint
     with a forward target forwards them unchanged, and an M1 daemon with none
     ignores them without emitting the not-implemented error. A-013 malformed-
     frame handling remains unchanged.
why: This fills only the wire/state details H7 must implement, repairs the
     snapshot request direction in the direction C.7 already promises, and
     uses daemon-lifetime local state rather than inventing sessions,
     authorization, M3 controls, or H4/H5-specific behavior.

[A-017] [H4] [SPEC C.7 thread.snapshot / thread.create] [P2, P3]
gap: H4 must render authoritative snapshot messages and a thread list, while
     C.7 leaves each message object's shape, thread creation/listing, the
     browser's required outer machine_id, and the trigger for recovering a
     backpressured live subscription undefined.
law: In M1, daemon-authored `thread.snapshot.messages` use these minimum JSON
     objects. A user message is `{message_id,run_id,role:"user",content,state}`
     where `message_id` is the run's prompt_id, both IDs are ULIDs, content is
     a string, and state is one of `queued`, `running`, `end_turn`,
     `cancelled`, `error`, or `budget_exceeded`. An assistant message is
     `{message_id,run_id,role:"assistant",content,thinking,events,partial}`
     where `message_id` equals `run_id`, both are ULIDs, content and thinking
     are strings, events is an array of JSON objects, and partial is boolean.
     Additional JSON members are allowed and ignored by clients that do not
     understand them. A matching snapshot replaces the browser's transcript,
     open gate, active run, and usage for that thread; it is never merged with
     cached messages or prior deltas.

     The M1 browser owns a per-browser navigation catalog of
     `{thread_id,title,created_at,updated_at}` in local storage. `thread_id` is
     a browser-generated UUID, timestamps are ISO 8601 strings, and title is
     `New thread` until the first submitted prompt, then the first 48 Unicode
     code points of that prompt after collapsing whitespace, with `…` appended
     exactly when the normalized prompt exceeds 48 code points. `created_at`
     is fixed at catalog insertion; `updated_at` changes on each prompt submit.
     Creating or selecting a catalog entry sends a `thread.snapshot` request
     with payload `{request:true}` for that UUID; the first prompt creates
     daemon state through the existing prompt.submit path. The catalog is only
     local navigation metadata: snapshot remains transcript authority, the
     daemon provides no M1 thread enumeration or persistence, and
     `thread.create` gains no M1 behavior.

     A browser-authored direct-link envelope uses the literal machine_id
     `direct` until it has observed a daemon envelope, then echoes the latest
     non-blank daemon machine_id. The M1 direct daemon does not consult this
     field for identity or authority; future relay targeting supersedes the
     direct-link sentinel. Every browser-authored envelope still receives a
     fresh ULID and timestamp.

     When bounded live delivery or a connection outbox drops a subscriber, the
     daemon closes that WebSocket with code 1013 and reason
     `snapshot resync required`. The browser reconnects, requests its selected
     thread snapshot, and replaces local thread state before consuming later
     live events; it does not poll or replay buffered deltas.
why: This supplies only the render and navigation facts H4 already requires,
     formalizes H7's existing snapshot rows, and avoids inventing server-side
     thread storage, a title model call, sessions, or an authority boundary.
